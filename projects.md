In my spare time, I have developed a couple of open-source projects on github and try to maintain them:

- [SharpDX](http://sharpdx.org) The definitive DirectX wrapper for .NET
- [SharpDoc](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpDoc) A documentation generator for .NET
- [SharpCLABot](https://github.com/SharpCLABot/SharpCLABot) An ASP.NET application providing CLA bot for github projects, hostable on Azure
- [SharpYaml](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpYaml/) A YAML parser (this is a fork)
- [SharpRazor](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpRazor) A simple wrapper around the templating Razor Engine 
- [SharpDiff](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpDiff) A diff library for .NET with added support for a diff3 on .NET objects (this is a fork)

I developed also some older projects on codeplex that are no longer updated:

- [NShader](https://nshader.codeplex.com/) A HLSL/GLSL syntax highlighter for Visual Studio 
- [AsmHighlighter](https://asmhighlighter.codeplex.com/) A ASM x86 syntax highlighter for Visual Studio
- [NetAsm](https://netasm.codeplex.com/) An attempt to hack the JIT of the .NET CLR to inject ASM instructions directly from method attributes
- [NKnobMan](https://nknobman.codeplex.com/) An extension to [Knobman](http://www.g200kg.com/en/software/knobman.html)   
- [NRenoiseTools](https://nrenoisetools.codeplex.com/) A Renoise file exporter to MIDI 

I have also contributed to some open source projects:

- [NAudio](https://naudio.codeplex.com/) A popular Audio framework for .NET
